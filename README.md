### Hi there, I'm not an evil person I'm just a programmer ðŸ‘‹

```javascript
/*
* things that everyone should know
*
* 1. Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
* Written by Martin Fowler 
*
* 2. The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.
* Written by Kernighan and Ritchie
*
* 3. Code never lies, comments sometimes do.
* Written by Ron Jeffries
*
*
* 4. In May of 1999, we were able to debug and fix a race condition that had not shown up during ground testing.
* Debugging a program running on a $100M piece of hardware that is 100 million km away is an interesting experience.
* Having a (REPL) read-eval-print-loop running on the spacecraft proved invaluable in finding and fixing the problem.
* Written by Ron Garret NASA Jet Propulsion Lab Engineer

// Day 1:
// I am not sure if we need this, but too scared to delete. 
//
//  Day 2:
// I am not responsible of this code.
// They made me write it, against my will
//
// Day 3:
// I am not sure why this works but it fixes the problem.

// Day 4:
// hack for ie browser (assuming that ie is a browser)
